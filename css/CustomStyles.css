The text describes their expanded second-person perspective, which involves recognizing the importance of others perceptions and making oneself appealing for social acceptance. Cognitively, individuals in this stage display primary actions and concrete operations, focusing on external features and rudimentary internal states, with conflict often avoided or suppressed. Their language tends to be impersonal and positive, filled with clich√©s and stereotypical phrases. They exhibit a deep-seated fear of rejection and disapproval, seeking social acceptance and adjusting to group norms to maintain their sense of self-worth. Emotionally, they express simple, acceptable feeling states and rely on defense mechanisms such as projection and introjection to cope with anxiety and maintain a positive self-image. However, they may struggle with identifying and articulating their own emotions, fearing vulnerability and rejection. Socially, individuals in this stage conform to group rules and norms, seeking acceptance and protection from larger entities with clear identities and hierarchical structures. They may exhibit a tendency to give advice and evaluate others based on their own preferences, often believing their way is the only correct way. Despite their desire for belonging and conformity, individuals at this stage may experience conflict when faced with differing value sets or when belonging to multiple groups with conflicting norms. Overall, their sense of self is closely tied to external validation and group acceptance, leading to a dependent, sticky quality in their relationships." ;

These individuals demonstrate abstract operations, allowing them to consider multiple possibilities and solutions to problems. However, they may struggle to prioritize these solutions and often focus on doing things correctly rather than determining the most effective approach. Self-conscious individuals have a sense of specialness and differentiation from others, but they constantly compare themselves to others and fear losing their sense of identity. They may intellectualize and rationalize their behaviors and beliefs to maintain their self-image and resist vulnerability. Cognitively, individuals in this stage use more complex syntax and vocabulary, with a passive interest in causality and a beginning introspection into their own behaviors and traits. However, they may exhibit rigid thinking and a reluctance to accept criticism or alternative viewpoints. Socially, self-conscious individuals seek acceptance and respect from peer groups and organizations based on their expertise and knowledge. They may display perfectionist tendencies and resist collaboration, preferring to maintain control over tasks and processes. Despite their contributions to efficiency and problem-solving, individuals at this stage may struggle with delegating tasks and evaluating others' capabilities objectively. They may exhibit intellectual aggression and argumentativeness, often ridiculing others and imposing their views on others. Overall, while self-conscious individuals play essential roles in society and organizations, their rigid thinking and perfectionism can pose challenges in interpersonal relationships and collaboration.";

These individuals exhibit a self-questioning attitude and adopt the fourth person perspective, which involves recognizing multiple perspectives and the complexity of systems and cultural conditioning. At this stage, individuals realize that things are rarely what they seem and embrace paradoxes and contradictions. They shift from linear, intellectual logic to a more holistic understanding of the world, valuing connections and subtle clues over isolated analysis. They are deeply concerned with their interior world, feelings, and motivations, showing an awareness of inner conflict and ambivalence. From a social perspective, they recognize the subjective nature of interpretation and abandon purely rational analysis in favor of a more holistic approach. They can integrate rational thought with non-linear approaches and empathize with others, tolerating different ideas and behaviors. However, individuals at this stage may experience inner conflict and despair about finding their true selves, grappling with the many contradictions and subpersonalities within them. Despite their admiration from others for their self-expression and spontaneity, they may also be feared or dismissed as unpredictable or dreamers. Their relationships with others can be intense and mutually rewarding when there is synergy, but they may also struggle with managing others due to their autocratic or idiosyncratic tendencies. Overall, individuals at this stage may face anxiety and depression as they navigate the complexities of their inner world and society's demands." ;

Unitive individuals express themselves with unique and vivid expressions, often using creative metaphors to convey the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of existence. While their responses may vary in complexity, simplicity is not necessarily indicative of their depth; spontaneity and straightforwardness are considered essential elements of wisdom and ego-transcendence. Unlike individuals in earlier stages who may seek meaning to bolster their ego identifications, Unitive adults stand outside this desperate need for meaning-making. They perceive the non-necessity of shielding and bolstering ego identities, allowing them to transcend the limitations of personal realms and embrace a broader, more interconnected view of reality.";
